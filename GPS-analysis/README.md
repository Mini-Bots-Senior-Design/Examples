## Overview: This is a proof of concept to see if we can get accurate data with the GPS device

**Prototype 1:** J
1. Just read and print lat, lon

**Prototype 3:**
1. read from button press
2. create logic to find euclidan distance
3. print lat, lon, and distance

**Prototype 3:**
1. read from button press
2. create logic to find euclidan distance
3. creat elogic to find angle
4. print lat, lon, angle, and distance

**Prototype 4:**
1. read from button press
2. create logic to find euclidan distance
3. creat elogic to find angle
4. print lat, lon, angle, and distance
5. Plot



Parking Lot Plotting
Setup: Two gps devices next to each other on the roof of my car at a park. 
1. Still: time, lat, lon, distance [DONE] (car off)
2. Still: time, lat, lon, angle, distance [IN_PROGRESS] (car off)
3. Rocking: time, lat, lon, angle, distance [NOT_STARTED]
4. Around the park: time, lat, lon, angle, distance [NOT_STARTED
5. 


Notes:
opened the car door at like 12:54
again at 12:56:38 to move the wires
1:06:00 turned car on did not move
1:08:00 stopped test (2)

1:10:00 started rocking test (3)
1:15:00 stopped rocking test (3)

1:17:00 sta
1:25:00 stoppedcle
